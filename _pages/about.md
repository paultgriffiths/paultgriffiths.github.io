I am an atmospheric chemist and lecturer in the Atmospheric Chemistry Research Group at the University of Bristol.  My research interests are in modelling chemistry-climate feedbacks, and in the evolution of atmospheric composition more generally.  

Before this, I worked for NCAS in their Long Term Climate Change Directorate, and have experience in cloud modelling, aerosol chemistry and various aspects of chemical physics.
