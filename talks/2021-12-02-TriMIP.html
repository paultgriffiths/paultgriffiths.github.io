Ensemble gives assessment of range of model data. Some regions of concern: BL/emissions influence, e.g. Tropics. Propose: assess regionally and using ensembles.</p> <p>ATA: analysis of O3PRE, O3RES and intermediates required</p> <p>David S: model evaluation using seasonal cycles and diurnal cycles</p> <p>Mike P: separate strat from trop as they have different patterns of change - strat varies little last 20 years - can also use strat O3 for evaluation, e.g. QBO, N2O, col O3. Budgets not very satisfying - don’t compare well. AToM shows that chemistry/transport effects important. Avoid residual methods - improve diagnostics for STT</p> <h3 id="budgets">Budgets</h3> <p>Olivia C: output dry deposition velocities, focus on process based diagnostics for model intercomparison</p> <p>KS: data request huge</p> <p>LM: frequently not accurate</p> <p>ATA: CCMI shows it can be done but narrow down data requirement</p> <p>MP: time for some sensitivity experiments: methane and O3 feedbacks.</p> <p>David S: did CMOR-ising add a burden?</p> <h3 id="chemistry-deck">Chemistry DeCK</h3> <p>ATA: a chemistry DeCK is (too) big.
